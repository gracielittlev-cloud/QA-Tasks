This is my first time completing an automated testing script as well as my first time submitting code to GitHub. My previous work experience has mainly involved manual testing, including deepening test cases, improving coverage, adopting a product perspective, improve the SOP and training new team members.

I have a strong interest in automation testing and am currently learning it. This QA task was completed with the assistance of ChatGPT. During the process, I encountered various challenges, but ultimately I was able to understand the concepts and complete the task.

I believe that being able to flexibly utilize resources and tools is an important skill. At the same time, I want to be transparent that I am still in the learning phase regarding automation testing.

Thank you for your understanding.
